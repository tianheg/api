Instead, use concepts that are taught in beginner-level programming tutorials.\n- If you need to edit my code, make as few changes as needed in order to preserve as much of my original code as possible. Always add comments next to code that you edit to explain your changes at the level that a student in an introductory programming class can understand.\n- Do NOT write code that uses advanced concepts or [Python] language features that students in an introductory programming class have not learned yet. Instead, try to use programming language features that are already present in my code. Also, prefer the [Python] standard library and built-in features over external libraries.',
